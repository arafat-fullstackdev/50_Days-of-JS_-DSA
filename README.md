# 50 Days of JS & DSA

Welcome to the **50 Days of JavaScript and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** challenge! This repository is dedicated to practicing and learning DSA concepts while improving JavaScript skills.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to:
- Enhance problem-solving skills.
- Build a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms.
- Improve proficiency in JavaScript for technical interviews and real-world problem-solving.

## Structure
The project is divided into 50 days, with each day focusing on a specific DSA topic or a set of JavaScript problems. Here's an example breakdown:

1. **Day 1-5**: Arrays and Strings
2. **Day 6-10**: Linked Lists
3. **Day 11-15**: Stacks and Queues
4. **Day 16-20**: Trees and Graphs
5. **Day 21-25**: Recursion
6. **Day 26-30**: Sorting Algorithms
7. **Day 31-35**: Searching Algorithms
8. **Day 36-40**: Dynamic Programming
9. **Day 41-45**: Advanced Graph Algorithms
10. **Day 46-50**: Mixed Problem-Solving

Each day's folder contains:
- **Problem Statement**: Description of the task.
- **Solution**: JavaScript code implementing the solution.
- **Explanation**: Comments or a separate markdown file explaining the approach.
